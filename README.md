# lucky-numbers

I'm so bad at choosing lottery numbers, so I created a way to pick some numbers for me. Unfortunately it's stopped working! Can you help? Here's what I tried to do:

1. When the user clicked the button, it should generate a list of 6 numbers
2. The numbers should be between 1 and 50, inclusive
3. I used functions to keep the code cleaner, so you shouldn't need to add new ones (also, please keep these ones as I have code that's depending on them.)
